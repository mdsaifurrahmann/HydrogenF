								<p>At Codebumble, we believe in transparency about collecting information from individuals using our sites and services. Codebumble may use cookies and similar technology to improve your experience on our sites. We use this information to customize our communications, analyze usage, measure success, and promote trust to users. For example, these features make it possible for us to pre-populate your username for easier login, allow user-specific messaging, or permit advertising unique to your apparent interests. Our site may also use web beacons, a clear electronic image used to assist in delivering cookies on our sites and allow us to count users who have visited specific pages. We may include web beacons in promotional emails or newsletters to determine if messages have been opened or clicked on.</p>
								<p>By continuing to visit or use our sites or services, you agree to cookies and similar technologies for these purposes.</p>
								<h4 class="text-indigo-500">Here’s how cookies help us monitor site analytics:</h4>
								<p>Codebumble utilizes a third-party website analytics service to monitor visitor trends on our website. The service, Google Analytics, sets a cookie - a small, unique text file - on your computer so we can monitor site traffic. Codebumble uses the information gathered to make your browsing experience more enjoyable. The cookie is for tracking purposes only and is not used to collect or distribute personally identifiable information. For more information on Google Analytics, visit http://www.google.com/analytics/.</p>
								<h4 class="text-indigo-500">Here’s how behavior display ads, retargeting ads, and targeting cookies work on our social media:</h4>
								<p><strong>Facebook Cookies:</strong> Codebumble may use the pixel function of Facebook Custom Audiences to identify users who have landed on particular pages of codebumble.net for targeted group-orientated remarketing and advertising. The Facebook pixel stores a cookie, which means we will share that information about your visit to our site with Facebook. Also, as part of the advanced matching functionality undertaken by Facebook, other personal information (such as telephone number, email address, Facebook ID) may be shared with Facebook in a protected form. These cookies and the data collected are used to create target groups to help Facebook deliver advertising on our behalf to users who have previously visited our site when they are on Facebook or a digital platform powered by Facebook Advertising and to track advertising success. You can modify your Facebook Ad settings to restrict these advertisements. Navigate Settings/Adverts in your Facebook account to adjust your preferences. For more information on Facebook’s cookie policy, visit https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/.</p>
								<p><strong>LinkedIn Targeting Cookies:</strong> We may use LinkedIn Insight Tags across our site to monitor traffic from the LinkedIn social media platform. The LinkedIn Insight Tag is a lightweight JavaScript code added to our site to enable campaign reporting and provide us with insights about visitors to our site. For more information on LinkedIn’s cookie policy, visit https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/cookie-table.</p>
								<h4 class="text-indigo-500">Here’s how web beacons and cookies work with our third-party vendors:</h4>
								<p><strong>Third-Party Vendors: </strong> Codebumble may occasionally hire other companies or contractors to provide limited services on our behalfs, such as the processing of mailings, technical or engineering support, site hosting, payment processing, or performing statistical analysis of our sites or services. Those service providers will be permitted to obtain only the information they need to deliver the agreed-upon service. They are required by agreement to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using the information for any purpose other than providing the service to Codebumble by our policies. However, our vendors may use aggregate data for fraud detection to help improve their services.</p>
								<p><strong>Third-Party Technologies:</strong> Third parties, such as ad servers, ad networks, and data exchanges (“advertisers”) may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies to tailor advertisements to your apparent interests and deliver those advertisements to you while you are on our sites. In addition, advertisers may use technologies to collect information about your browsing behavior on our sites to match the information they have previously collected. Codebumble's Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that advertisers may collect from you or that you choose to provide to them. For information about how to opt-out of receiving certain behavioral advertisements, please visit our opt-out and cookie policies.</p>
								<p><strong>Social Media Widgets:</strong> Our site occasionally includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button or Share button, and widgets, such as interactive mini-programs. These features may collect your IP address, which page(s) you visit our website, and set a cookie to enable the feature to function correctly. Social media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the company's privacy statement providing the features.</p>
